# Statistics_using_R

<h2>Project Description</h2>
In this project, I demonstrated analytical and computational skills such as R/RStudio, R Markdown and R Script. I conducted a number of statistical analyses including Spearman's rank correlation, Kendall's tau-b, and Wilcoxon Sum Rank Test. I demonstrate my abilities in data manipulation, hypothesis testing and deriving insightful conclusions from data. Furthermore, I used non-parametric methods to examine variations in median mathematical skills among employees from various departments and investigate correlations between the size and locations of abalones. This project highlights my ability to implement complex statistical methods in R, interpret results accurately, and present findings clearly and concisely.
